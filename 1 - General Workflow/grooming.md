Gentle reminder to us all (including me) to put context and descriptions sa PRs and Issues na ginagawa naten.

Been doing a browse and review of our issues and PRs of the past weeks/month and napansin ko mejo dumadami ung mga "orphaned" issues and PRs, mga PR/Issues na di alam san nanggaling, mga "vague"/generic ung titles and descriptions, hindi clear ung purpose.
As part of improving our processes (and overall wellbeing) Please make sure to have sufficient descriptions and context sa PRs and Issues natin after creating them (our future selves will be super thankful to us when we are consistent in doing this)

Not much of a guideline (formal guideline hope to come soon), pero make sure to have atleast some of the ff:
1. describe purpose/goal in the Title and/or descriptions - issue/pr descriptions are optional pag clear ung "goal"  sa title palang, if ang title is "update this and that" lang, please add description specifying the "goal" of the issue or PR, good titles/descriptions include, 
- able to answer ung "ano ang goal or anong masosolve na problem neto kapag na done/merge?", screenshots of anything, UI before and after merge, gif of things, etc
2. and if generic  ung title and walang description, please make sure to atleast provide context, have another issue/pr na nakalink para ma track natin and mafigureout kung para saan sya.

think of it siguro like sa code din, like imagine if "6 mos" down the line eh binuksan natin ung PR/Issue na to, magegets ba natin para saan sya at kung bakit/ano ginagawa nya? the diff section defonitely help pero minsan, kahit nakikita natin ung diff, hirap padin magets kung walang context.
